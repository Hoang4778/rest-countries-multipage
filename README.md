# Rest Countries API multipage

## Description

This is the challenge on Frontend Mentor website (the site that helps people practice their frontend coding skill based on the UI design).

## Live version

This project is live via [this link](https://restcountryapi222.netlify.app/).

## How to run the project on local machine

1. Download the source codes to your computer and open it on a text editor of your choice.

2. Install `node_modules` by running:
```
npm install
```
For those who have not installed NodeJS just yet, here is the [link](https://nodejs.org/en/), just download the LTS version and keep on with your work.

3. Open the site on local server by running this command:
```
npm run dev
```

**Note: if you want to build the app after making some changes, run the command `npm run build` to proceed**

## What this site can do

This is the info page about all countries in the world, so it can:
- Display all countries available according to the world stat.
- Sort the countries based on name search and regions.
- Show basic info of one country such as population, language, currency.etc.

## One side note for this project

I used Sveltekit to build this app, it is worth knowing that Sveltekit can do much more than fetching data and displaying them on the UI. If you like trying things out, be sure to check this framework out, although at the time of making this ReadMe, Sveltekit is still under development. Hopefully, there will be more people implementing this tool in their project.
